# VeteransBenefits
Project repo for r/VeteransBenefits project

V1 - Code Milestone 1
This application currently functions as the foundation for our website and is aimed to help gather aid for Veterans, something that is typically made overly complex and confusing. Our goal with this website and project as a whole is to make sure that Veterans have an easier system and congregation of information to gather benefits for their service

Release Notes: Basic frontend and backend funtionality. Refinement towards desired functionality in progress. 

Note: There currently only exists a main branch for this application which contains all code and resources worked on so far
