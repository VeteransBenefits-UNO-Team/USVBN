      <section class="content-section card convalescent-rating">
        <h3>Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating)</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans recently discharged from hospitalization may qualify for a
          temporary 100% rating under specific conditions. This rating generally
          applies for 1 to 3 months, with possible extensions up to 6 months.
          Further extensions may be granted based on individual evaluations.
        </p>
        <h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The surgery or procedure must be linked to a service-connected
            condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eligibility includes at least one month of convalescence or in cases
            of severe postoperative complications such as unhealed surgical
            wounds, recent amputations, or the necessity for extended
            immobilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more,
            also qualifies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Following the convalescence period,
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/cnp"
            rel="nofollow"
            >a reevaluation</a
          >
          of the Veteran's disability status will occur, unless a minimum rating
          is pre-determined by the schedule or the Veteran already has a 0%
          rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans may be eligible for Special Monthly Compensation
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/smc"
            rel="nofollow"
            >(SMC) S</a
          >
          during the convalescence period. If the rating schedule specifies a
          temporary 100% rating for a certain duration (e.g., 6, 12 months), an
          additional month of 100% rating is granted, extending the period to 7,
          13 months, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans eligible for service connection retroactively during their
          convalescent period may file for back pay. Extensions of the temporary
          100% rating due to prolonged recovery can be requested with medical
          evidence from a healthcare professional.
        </p>
        <h4>Filing for Temporary 100% Rating</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans can file for the temporary 100% rating with the assistance of
          a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) or by using
          <a
            href="https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-526ez-are.pdf"
            rel="nofollow"
            >VA Form 21-536ez</a
          >. In cases where the surgery was performed at a VA facility, the VA
          is responsible for initiating the claim process. Consequently, the
          Veteran may not need to file themselves.

        <h4>Apportionment Process</h4>
        <p>
          In cases where a Veteran's spouse or dependents are dependent on the
          Veteran's disability compensation, they may request an apportionment.
          This means they can appeal for a portion, or all, of the reduced
          compensation to be redirected to them, based on demonstrated financial
          need.
        </p>

        <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Veterans receiving

            will not receive these payments while incarcerated.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a Veteran’s conviction is overturned on appeal, their disability
            compensation, minus any apportioned amounts, will be reinstated.

      <!-- Pyramiding Rule Section -->
      <section class="content-section card pyramiding">
        <h3>Pyramiding Rule</h3>
        <p>
          The Pyramiding Rule prevents the same disability or symptom from being
          rated more than once. This means a Veteran cannot receive multiple
          disability ratings for the same symptom, even if caused by different
          conditions.
        </p>

        <h4>Example of the Pyramiding Rule</h4>
        <p>
          For instance, if a Veteran has two different knee conditions leading
          to reduced range of motion, they cannot receive separate ratings for
          each condition's impact on their mobility. Instead, a single rating
          reflecting the overall impairment is provided.
        </p>

        <h4>Common Pyramiding Errors</h4>
        <p>
          Newer raters may occasionally make errors in rating disabilities,
          leading to improper application of the Pyramiding Rule. Veterans
          should be aware of these common errors, especially when they have
          active ratings for conditions that may overlap.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sleep Apnea and Asthma</li>
          <li>
            Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease
            (GERD)

            PTSD and TBI*<br />
            <span class="footnote"
              >*A single rating is applied unless the examiner can distinctly
              differentiate the symptoms of each condition.</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Veterans with ratings for any of the above overlapping conditions are
          advised to consult with a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) before filing
          new claims or seeking rating increases. This consultation can help
          prevent adjustments that might inadvertently lower the overall
          disability rating.

      <!-- Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating) Section -->
      <section class="content-section card hospitalizations">
        <h3>Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating)</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans hospitalized for 22 or more continuous days at a VA hospital,
          or an approved facility, due to a service-connected condition are
          eligible for a 100% disability rate. This rate is retroactively
          applied from the day of admission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 100% rating is maintained until the end of the month in which the
          Veteran is discharged. However, for hospitalizations extending six
          months or more due to a

        </p>
        <h4>Filing for Temporary 100% Rating Due to Hospitalization</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans can initiate a claim for the temporary 100% rating with the
          help of a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) or by submitting
          <a

            rel="nofollow"
            >VA Form 21-536ez</a
          >. In instances where the Veteran is hospitalized at a VA facility,
          the VA typically manages the claim process, potentially obviating the
          need for the Veteran to file.

      <!-- Analogous and Equivalent Disabilities Section -->
      <section class="content-section card analogous-and-equivalent">
        <h3>Analogous and Equivalent Disabilities</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the the sheer volume and duplication of symptoms that the human
          mind and body can have, it is impractical for the rating schedule to
          have a rating for every single disability by name. In such cases that
          the Veteran's disability/disease/condition is not mentioned by name in
          the rating schedule, it will be rated under the most comparable
          rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take for instance, there is only a rating for migraine type headaches
          in the schedule. If the Veteran has a diagnosis of headaches, the VA
          will rate under the migraine schedule.

        <h3>Extra Scheduler</h3>
        <p>
          In exceptional or unusual circumstances in which the Veteran has
          factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent
          periods of hospitalization, the VA Director of Compensation Service
          may grant a rating that is higher than what is provided for in the
          rating schedule. Do know, these cases are exceptionally rare!

      <!-- Protections Section -->
      <section class="content-section card legal-protections">
        <h3>Legal Protections for Veterans' Disability Ratings</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans are entitled to legal protections regarding their disability
          ratings, which vary based on the duration the rating has been held.
          These protections do not apply in cases of fraud, but it's important
          to note that administrative errors by the VA are not considered fraud.
        </p>

        <h4>5-Year Protection Against Reductions</h4>
        <p>
          A Veteran's disability rating that has been in place for 5 continuous
          years cannot be reduced solely based on a single
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/w/cnp"
            rel="nofollow"
            >C&P exam</a
          >
          or records review showing improvement. If improvement is noted, a
          subsequent reevaluation may occur. Continued improvement may lead to
          <a

            rel="nofollow"

          >
          in the rating.
        </p>

        <h4>10-Year Protection for Service Connection</h4>
        <p>
          After maintaining a service-connected disability rating for 10
          continuous years, the connection cannot be severed, except in cases of
          proven fraud or incorrect service records. This protection stands even
          if the condition improves or if the Veteran is eligible for a rating
          increase or secondary service connection.
        </p>

        <h4>20-Year Total Protection</h4>
        <p>
          Once a Veteran has held a disability rating for 20 continuous years,
          the rating is completely protected and cannot be reduced under any
          circumstances.
        </p>

        <h4>Other Important Protections</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Amputation Rule:</strong> If a Veteran undergoes a
            non-service connected amputation of a service-connected part, the
            original disability rating will continue unchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Changes in the Rating Schedule:</strong> Veterans are
            grandfathered under the older rating schedule when changes occur. If
            improvement is detected under the old schedule, the rating may be
            adjusted according to the current schedule. Ratings are evaluated
            based on the schedule in effect on the

          <li>
            <strong>Age Consideration (Over 55):</strong> Commonly
            misunderstood, being over 55 does not provide rating protection.
            However, it generally exempts Veterans from regular reexaminations,
            except in specific cases like post-surgery evaluations or conditions
            like cancer.

      <!-- FAQ Section -->
      <section class="content-section card faq">
        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h4>What Happens When the Rating Schedule Changes?</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans are grandfathered under the older schedule if the rating
          schedule changes. However, if improvement is observed under the old
          schedule, the rating may be adjusted according to the current
          schedule. A Veteran's rating will not automatically change even if the
          new schedule is more beneficial.
        </p>

        <h4>Do I Need to Seek Treatment to Maintain My Ratings?</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans are not required to seek treatment through the VA or any
          other means specifically to maintain their ratings, unlike some Social
          Security requirements.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Can My Disability Ratings be Lowered if My Disabilities Improve?
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Continuous Medication Usage:</strong> If the schedule mentions
          medication usage, the rating will be as stated, potentially resulting
          in a higher rating. If the schedule does not mention medication,
          continuous usage should not lead to a reduction, although improvement
          may affect the rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-Continuous Medication Usage:</strong> The rating is based
          on where symptoms settle after discontinuing medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Treatments/Surgeries:</strong> After treatment or
          surgery, ratings are based on where symptoms settle. A Convalescent
          rating of temporary 100% is applied post-surgery, followed by a
          reevaluation. The minimum rating dictated by the schedule will apply
          unless the level of disability warrants a higher rating.
