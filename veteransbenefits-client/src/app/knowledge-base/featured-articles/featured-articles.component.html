      <h2>Important Notice</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Caution:</strong> The misuse of this schedule is strictly
        prohibited and may constitute a legal offense. It is intended to
        facilitate a deeper understanding of the criteria used by the VA in
        evaluating conditions. We encourage you to use this resource to gain
        insights into the assessment process and to articulate your condition
        more effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please Note:</strong> This schedule is not a checklist for
        self-diagnosis or representation. Its purpose is solely informational
        and educational.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the extensive nature of the content, we have organized this
        schedule into various system categories and sub-components for ease of
        navigation and comprehension. You are welcome to review the complete
        rating schedule and M21-1 documents; however, you may find our
        structured summaries more accessible and user-friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information provided here is based on the latest rating schedule as
        of November 2021.

      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Analogous and Equivalent Disabilities</h3>
        <p>
          Due to the the sheer volume and duplication of symptoms that the human
          mind and body can have, it is impractical for the rating schedule to
          have a rating for every single disability by name. In such cases that
          the Veteran's disability/disease/condition is not mentioned by name in
          the rating schedule, it will be rated under the most comparable
          rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take for instance, there is only a rating for migraine type headaches
          in the schedule. If the Veteran has a diagnosis of headaches, the VA
          will rate under the migraine schedule.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Convalescent Rating Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Convalescent Rating (Temporary 100% Rating)</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans recently discharged from hospitalization may qualify for a
          temporary 100% rating under specific conditions. This rating generally
          applies for 1 to 3 months, with possible extensions up to 6 months.
          Further extensions may be granted based on individual evaluations.
        </p>
        <h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The surgery or procedure must be linked to a service-connected
            condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eligibility includes at least one month of convalescence or in cases
            of severe postoperative complications such as unhealed surgical
            wounds, recent amputations, or the necessity for extended
            immobilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more,
            also qualifies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Following the convalescence period, a reevaluation of the Veteran's
          disability status will occur, unless a minimum rating is
          pre-determined by the schedule or the Veteran already has a 0% rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans may be eligible for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) S
          during the convalescence period. If the rating schedule specifies a
          temporary 100% rating for a certain duration (e.g., 6, 12 months), an
          additional month of 100% rating is granted, extending the period to 7,
          13 months, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans eligible for service connection retroactively during their
          convalescent period may file for back pay. Extensions of the temporary
          100% rating due to prolonged recovery can be requested with medical
          evidence from a healthcare professional.
        </p>
        <h4>Filing for Temporary 100% Rating</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans can file for the temporary 100% rating with the assistance of
          a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) or by using VA Form 21-536ez. In
          cases where the surgery was performed at a VA facility, the VA is
          responsible for initiating the claim process. Consequently, the
          Veteran may not need to file themselves.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating) Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Hospitalizations (Temporary 100% Rating)</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans hospitalized for 22 or more continuous days at a VA hospital,
          or an approved facility, due to a service-connected condition are
          eligible for a 100% disability rate. This rate is retroactively
          applied from the day of admission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 100% rating is maintained until the end of the month in which the
          Veteran is discharged. However, for hospitalizations extending six
          months or more due to a mental disorder, the 100% rating continues for
          six months post-discharge, followed by a reevaluation to assess the
          current level of disability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on their existing disability ratings, Veterans may qualify
          for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) S during their hospitalization.
        </p>
        <h4>Filing for Temporary 100% Rating Due to Hospitalization</h4>
        <p>
          Veterans can initiate a claim for the temporary 100% rating with the
          help of a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) or by submitting VA Form
          21-536ez. In instances where the Veteran is hospitalized at a VA
          facility, the VA typically manages the claim process, potentially
          obviating the need for the Veteran to file.

      <!-- Extra Scheduler Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Extra Scheduler</h3>
        <p>
          In exceptional or unusual circumstances in which the Veteran has
          factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent
          periods of hospitalization, the VA Director of Compensation Service
          may grant a rating that is higher than what is provided for in the
          rating schedule. Do know, these cases are exceptionally rare!
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Incarcerated Veterans Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Incarcerated Veterans</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans incarcerated for more than 60 days in a Federal, State, or
          local penal institution due to a felony conviction will experience a
          reduction in their disability compensation.
        </p>

        <h4>Reduced Pay Structure</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For Veterans rated 20% or higher: Compensation is adjusted according
            to 38 USC § 1114(a), which currently equates to $123.
          </li>
          <li>
            For Veterans rated at 10%: The payment is reduced to half of the
            standard 10% rate.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Apportionment Process</h4>
        <p>
          In cases where a Veteran's spouse or dependents are dependent on the
          Veteran's disability compensation, they may request an apportionment.
          This means they can appeal for a portion, or all, of the reduced
          compensation to be redirected to them, based on demonstrated financial
          need.
        </p>

        <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Veterans receiving Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) will not
            receive these payments while incarcerated.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a Veteran’s conviction is overturned on appeal, their disability
            compensation, minus any apportioned amounts, will be reinstated.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Protections Section -->
      <section class="content-section">
        <h3>Legal Protections for Veterans' Disability Ratings</h3>
        <p>
          Veterans are entitled to legal protections regarding their disability
          ratings, which vary based on the duration the rating has been held.
          These protections do not apply in cases of fraud, but it's important
          to note that administrative errors by the VA are not considered fraud.
        </p>

        <h4>5-Year Protection Against Reductions</h4>
        <p>
          A Veteran's disability rating that has been in place for 5 continuous
          years cannot be reduced solely based on a single C&P exam or records
          review showing improvement. If improvement is noted, a subsequent
          reevaluation may occur. Continued improvement may lead to a proposal
          for reduction in the rating.
        </p>

        <h4>10-Year Protection for Service Connection</h4>
        <p>
          After maintaining a service-connected disability rating for 10
          continuous years, the connection cannot be severed, except in cases of
          proven fraud or incorrect service records. This protection stands even
          if the condition improves or if the Veteran is eligible for a rating
          increase or secondary service connection.
        </p>

        <h4>20-Year Total Protection</h4>
        <p>
          Once a Veteran has held a disability rating for 20 continuous years,
          the rating is completely protected and cannot be reduced under any
          circumstances.
        </p>

        <h4>Other Important Protections</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Amputation Rule:</strong> If a Veteran undergoes a
            non-service connected amputation of a service-connected part, the
            original disability rating will continue unchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Changes in the Rating Schedule:</strong> Veterans are
            grandfathered under the older rating schedule when changes occur. If
            improvement is detected under the old schedule, the rating may be
            adjusted according to the current schedule. Ratings are evaluated
            based on the schedule in effect on the effective date of the grant.
            A staged evaluation may apply if the new schedule is more favorable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Age Consideration (Over 55):</strong> Commonly
            misunderstood, being over 55 does not provide rating protection.
            However, it generally exempts Veterans from regular reexaminations,
            except in specific cases like post-surgery evaluations or conditions
            like cancer. Filing a secondary claim may prompt a reevaluation of
            the primary condition.
          </li>
        </ul>
